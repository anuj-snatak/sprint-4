## 1. What is Migration?

**Migration** refers to the process of moving **data, applications, or entire systems** from one environment to another.
This can include:

* Moving from one server to another
* Upgrading to a new platform or cloud provider
* Changing databases or frameworks

---

## 2. Why is Migration Needed?

Migration is essential for:

*  Improving performance or scalability
*  Reducing cost (e.g., moving to the cloud)
*  Enhancing security and reliability
*  Upgrading outdated systems

---

## 3. Types of Migration

| Type                      | Description                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Migration**        | Transferring data between storage types/formats or systems       |
| **Application Migration** | Moving applications between environments (e.g., on-prem → cloud) |
| **Cloud Migration**       | Entire infrastructure moved to cloud (e.g., AWS, Azure)          |
| **Database Migration**    | Switching from one DB to another (e.g., MySQL → PostgreSQL)      |

---

## 4. Common Migration Scenarios

* Migrating legacy apps to cloud
* Moving monolithic apps to microservices
* Shifting from physical servers to virtual machines
* Changing cloud providers (e.g., Azure to AWS)

---

## 5. Migration Process (Step-by-Step)

1. **Assessment:**
   Understand the current environment and goals of migration.

2. **Planning:**
   Choose the right strategy (e.g., lift-and-shift, refactor, rebuild).

3. **Testing:**
   Run pilot migrations or test environments.

4. **Migration Execution:**
   Perform the actual data/app transfer.

5. **Validation:**
   Test functionality, integrity, and performance post-migration.

6. **Monitoring:**
   Ensure stability and address any post-migration issues.

## 6. Tools Used in Migration

| Tool                  | Use Case                            |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **rsync**             | File-based migration                |
| **AWS DMS**           | AWS Database Migration Service      |
| **Azure Migrate**     | Azure migration service             |
| **Docker/Podman**     | Containerizing apps for portability |
| **Robo 3T / DBeaver** | Verifying DB after migration        |

---

## 7. Best Practices

*  Always **backup** before migration
*  Monitor performance before & after
*  Perform **dry runs** or test migrations
*  Schedule migration during low traffic
*  Document each step for traceability

---

## 8. Challenges Faced

*  Data corruption or loss
*  Downtime if not planned properly
*  Incompatibility between old and new platforms
*  Team coordination and communication gaps

---

## 9. Real-life Example

> **Scenario:** Migrating an on-premise eCommerce application to AWS.

* Backend: Java Spring Boot
* Database: MySQL
* Process:

  * Created AMIs and Snapshots
  * Shifted DB using AWS DMS
  * Used S3 for static assets
  * Deployed app via EC2 and ELB

Outcome:
 Reduced latency by 30%
 Improved uptime to 99.99%
 Easier scaling for sales season
